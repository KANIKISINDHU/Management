Store Management Portal
Overview
The Store Management Portal is a web application built with React that enables store owners to manage their product inventory and generate invoices. It allows store owners to:

Generate and manage invoices
Manage product details (CRUD operations)
Search and filter products and invoices by various criteria
Optional authentication for store owners to secure access
Generate invoices as PDFs
This project is designed to give practical experience in building full-stack applications using React, managing state with React hooks, and implementing common web development functionalities like CRUD operations, filtering, and user authentication.

Features
Invoice Management:

View, edit, and delete invoices.
Calculate totals (without tax and with tax).
View detailed invoice information for each store.
Product Management:

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.
Display product details (name, description, price, etc.)
Filter products by store and search by product name.
PDF Generation (Optional):

Generate invoices as downloadable PDF files using jsPDF.
Authentication (Optional):

Login system for store owners.
Authentication ensures that only the store owner can view and manage their data.
Responsive Design:

The app is responsive and adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
